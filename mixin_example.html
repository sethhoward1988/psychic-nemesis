			<h1>The Mixin</h1>
			<p>Ruby allows classes to inherit from only one parent, but can use mixins for increased polymorphism. This is similar to an interface in Java. The example below shows how a class can mixin the Enumerable module and receive helpful methods as long as it implements the 'each' method.</p>
			<code>class MyArray include Enumerable end</code>
