			<h2>Meet Ruby</h2>
			<p>
				Ruby is an <strong>object-oriented, dynamic, general-purpose, programming language</strong>.
			</p>
			<h3>Object Oriented</h3>
			<p>
				Ruby is an object-oriented programming language with classes that define object attributes and behaviors. Objects can inherit attributes and behaviors from parent objects, which is a powerful feature of object-oriented design.
			</p>	
			<h3>Dynamic</h3>
			<p>
				Ruby is dynamic in that methods and objects can be manipulated and extended at run-time. Classes are never truly cemented down in Ruby as methods and attributes can be added while the program is running if necessary.
			</p>
			<h3>General Purpose</h3>
			<p>
				Ruby is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)#Features" target="_blank">full-featured</a> programming language that can be used in many situations. It is particularly useful as the server-side solution in web development.
